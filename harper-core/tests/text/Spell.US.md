# Spell

This document contains a list of words spelled correctly in some dialects of English, but not American English. This is designed to test the spelling suggestions we give for such mistakes.

To achieve this, the filename of this file contains `.US.`, which will tell the snapshot generator to use the American dialect, rather than trying to use an automatically detected dialect.
