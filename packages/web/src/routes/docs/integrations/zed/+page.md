For our Zed integration, we have an [extension](https://github.com/zed-extensions/harper) that automatically downloads and runs [`harper-ls`](./language-server). For more information on how to install it and how it works, you can head over to the [extension's README](https://github.com/zed-extensions/harper/blob/main/README.md).
